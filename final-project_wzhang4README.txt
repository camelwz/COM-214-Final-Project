Project members: William Zhang, Adeyosola Ajayi, Oybek Sobirov

Developmental process:
Adeyosola met with Prof. Tarimo and divided the project into three parts based on feedback. 

I (William) handled setting up the actual Rails project itself and the various models (columns, validations). This included user authorization and the sessions system, also ensuring that users could only see their own Categories and Todos.

Adeyosola handled the frontend and coded the vast majority of the web app's appearance and layout, including the navbar at the top.

Oybek handled building out most of the different html pages and handled the routing for the web app.

Towards the end we worked together a lot more and these roles became more mixed.
